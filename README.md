# Learn Claude Code -- Harness Engineering for Real Agents (C# Edition)

> A 20-lesson harness engineering tutorial in .NET 10 / C#. Each chapter
> ships as a self-contained `Program.cs` console app, sharing one
> `AgentCommon/` class library. The default engine is **DeepSeek
> (`deepseek-v4-flash`)** via its Anthropic-compatible endpoint; you
> provide your own API key.

## Agency Comes from the Model. An Agent Product = Model + Harness.

Before we write any code, one thing needs to be clear.

**Agency -- the capacity to perceive, reason, and act -- comes from model training, not from external code orchestration.** But a working agent product needs both the model and the harness. The model is the driver. The harness is the vehicle. This repository teaches you how to build the vehicle.

### Where Agency Comes From

At the core of every agent is a neural network -- a Transformer, an RNN, a trained function -- shaped by billions of gradient updates on sequences of perception, reasoning, and action. Agency was never bestowed by the surrounding code. It was learned during training.

Humans are the original proof. A biological neural network, refined by millions of years of evolutionary pressure, perceives the world through senses, reasons through a brain, and acts through a body. When DeepMind, OpenAI, or Anthropic say "agent," they all mean the same core thing: **a model that learned to act through training, plus the infrastructure that lets it operate in a specific environment.**

The historical record is unambiguous:

- **2013 -- DeepMind DQN plays Atari.** A single neural network, receiving only raw pixels and game scores, learned 7 Atari 2600 games -- surpassing prior algorithms and beating human experts in 3 of them. By 2015, scaled to [49 games at professional tester level](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236), published in *Nature*. No game-specific rules. One model, learning from experience.

- **2019 -- OpenAI Five conquers Dota 2.** Five neural networks played [45,000 years of Dota 2 against themselves](https://openai.com/index/openai-five-defeats-dota-2-world-champions/) over 10 months, then defeated **OG** -- the TI8 world champions -- 2-0 in a live match. In the public arena, the AI won 99.4% of 42,729 games. No scripted strategies. Models learned teamwork through self-play.

- **2019 -- DeepMind AlphaStar masters StarCraft II.** AlphaStar [beat a professional player 10-1](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/) in closed matches, then reached [Grandmaster rank](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03298-6) on the European server -- top 0.15% of 90,000 players. An incomplete-information, real-time game with a combinatorial action space far exceeding chess or Go.

- **2019 -- Tencent Jueyu dominates Honor of Kings.** Tencent AI Lab's "Jueyu" system [defeated KPL professional players in full 5v5](https://www.jiemian.com/article/3371171.html) at the World Champion Cup semifinal. In 1v1 mode, pros [won just 1 out of 15 matches, lasting under 8 minutes at best](https://developer.aliyun.com/article/851058). Training intensity: one day equaled 440 human years. A model that learned the entire game from scratch through self-play.

- **2024-2025 -- LLM agents reshape software engineering.** Claude, GPT, Gemini -- large language models trained on the full breadth of human code and reasoning -- are deployed as coding agents. They read codebases, write implementations, debug failures, and coordinate as teams. The architecture is identical to every previous agent: a trained model, placed in an environment, given tools for perception and action.

Every milestone points to the same fact: **Agency -- the ability to perceive, reason, and act -- is trained, not coded.** But every agent also needs an environment to operate in: an Atari emulator, the Dota 2 client, the StarCraft II engine, an IDE and a terminal. The model supplies the intelligence. The environment supplies the action space. Together they form a complete agent.

### What an Agent Is NOT

The word "agent" has been hijacked by an entire prompt-plumbing industry.

Drag-and-drop workflow builders. No-code "AI Agent" platforms. Prompt-chain orchestration libraries. They share a single delusion: that stringing LLM API calls together with if-else branches, node graphs, and hardcoded routing logic constitutes "building an agent."

It does not. What they produce are Rube Goldberg machines -- over-engineered, brittle, procedural rule pipelines with an LLM wedged in as a glorified text-completion node. That is not an agent. That is a shell script with grandiose pretensions.

You cannot brute-force intelligence by stacking procedural logic -- sprawling rule trees, node graphs, chained prompt waterfalls -- and praying that enough glue code will spontaneously produce autonomous behavior. It will not. You cannot engineer agency into existence. Agency is learned, not coded.

### The Mindshift: From "Building Agents" to Building Harnesses

When someone says "I am building an agent," they can only mean one of two things:

**1. Training a model.** Adjusting weights through reinforcement learning, fine-tuning, RLHF, or another gradient-based method. Collecting trajectory data -- real-world sequences of perception, reasoning, and action in a target domain -- and using it to shape the model's behavior. This is what DeepMind, OpenAI, Tencent AI Lab, and Anthropic do.

**2. Building a harness.** Writing the code that gives a model an operational environment. This is what most of us do, and it is the core of this repository.

A harness is everything an agent needs to work in a specific domain:

```
Harness = Tools + Knowledge + Observation + Action Interfaces + Permissions

    Tools:          file I/O, shell, network, database, browser
    Knowledge:      product docs, domain references, API specs, style guides
    Observation:    git diff, error logs, browser state, sensor data
    Action:         CLI commands, API calls, UI interactions
    Permissions:    sandbox isolation, approval workflows, trust boundaries
```

The model decides. The harness executes. The model reasons. The harness provides context. The model is the driver. The harness is the vehicle.

This repository teaches you to build the vehicle. A vehicle for coding. But the design patterns generalize to any domain.

### What Harness Engineers Actually Do

If you are reading this repository, you are most likely a harness engineer. Here is what the job actually entails:

- **Implement tools.** Give the agent hands. File read/write, shell execution, API calls, browser control, database queries. Each tool is one action the agent can take in its environment. Design them atomic, composable, and clearly described.

- **Curate knowledge.** Give the agent domain expertise. Product documentation, architecture decision records, style guides, compliance requirements. Load on demand, not upfront.

- **Manage context.** Give the agent clean memory. Subagent isolation prevents noise leakage. Context compaction prevents history from drowning the present. Task systems let goals persist beyond a single conversation.

- **Control permissions.** Give the agent boundaries. Sandbox file access. Require approval for destructive operations. Enforce trust boundaries between the agent and external systems.

- **Collect trajectory data.** Every action sequence the agent executes in your harness is training signal. Real deployment trajectories are the raw material for fine-tuning the next generation of agent models.

You are not writing intelligence. You are building the world that intelligence inhabits. The quality of that world directly determines how effectively the intelligence can express itself.

**Build the harness well. The model will do the rest.**

### Why Claude Code

Because Claude Code is the most elegant, most complete agent harness implementation we have seen. Not because of any clever trick, but because of what it *does not* do: it does not try to be the agent. It does not impose rigid workflows. It does not substitute hand-crafted decision trees for the model's own judgment. It gives the model tools, knowledge, context management, and permission boundaries -- then gets out of the way.

Strip Claude Code down to its essence:

```
Claude Code = one agent loop
            + tools (bash, read, write, edit, glob, grep, browser...)
            + on-demand skill loading
            + context compaction
            + subagent spawning
            + task system with dependency graphs
            + async mailbox team coordination
            + worktree-isolated parallel execution
            + permission governance
            + hooks extension system
            + memory persistence
            + MCP external capability routing
```

That is it. The agent itself? Claude. A model. Trained by Anthropic on the full breadth of human reasoning and code. The harness did not make Claude smart. Claude was already smart. The harness gave Claude hands, eyes, and a workspace.

The takeaway is not "copy Claude Code." The takeaway is: **the best agent products come from engineers who understand that their job is the harness, not the intelligence.**

                    THE AGENT PATTERN
                    =================

    User --> messages[] --> LLM --> response
                                      |
                            stop_reason == "tool_use"?
                           /                          \
                         yes                           no
                          |                             |
                    execute tools                    return text
                    append results
                    loop back -----------------> messages[]


    The model decides when to call tools and when to stop.
    The code just executes what the model asks for.
    This repo teaches you to build everything around this loop --
    the harness that makes the agent effective in a specific domain.
```

## Core Pattern

The agent loop is the same shape across every lesson. The C# version
lives in `AgentCommon/Agent/AgentHarness.cs` and is the file every
`Program.cs` ultimately calls into.

**C#** (`AgentCommon/Agent/AgentHarness.cs`, abbreviated):
```csharp
public async Task<LlmResponse> RunAsync(List<Message> messages, CancellationToken ct = default)
{
    var response = await Client.CreateMessageAsync(
        SystemPrompt, messages, Tools.AllSpecs().ToList(), ct: ct);
    messages.Add(Message.Assistant(response.Content));

    if (response.StopReason != "tool_use")
        return response;

    var results = new List<ToolResultBlock>();
    foreach (var block in response.Content.OfType<ToolUseBlock>())
    {
        var output = Tools.Invoke(block.Name, block.Input);
        results.Add(new ToolResultBlock(block.Id, output));
    }
    messages.Add(Message.UserToolResults(results));
    return response;
}
```

Every lesson layers one harness mechanism on top of this loop -- the loop itself never changes. The loop belongs to the agent. The mechanisms belong to the harness.

The loop is constant. Tools, knowledge, and permissions change. Agent = Model (LLM) + a generalized operational environment (Harness).

---

## Version Status

This repository contains the current 20-lesson track. The root-level
`s01_*` ... `s20_*` folders are the canonical version. Each chapter
contains a full narrative `README.md` (with English and Japanese
translations) and a runnable .NET 10 / C# `Program.cs` (plus the
shared `AgentCommon/` library).

The legacy 12-lesson track was previously preserved under `docs/`,
`agents/`, and the `web/` app. Those have been retired; the new
20-lesson track supersedes them.

---

## Scope

This repository is a 0-to-1 harness engineering learning project: it teaches how to build the working environment around an agent model. To keep the learning path clear, some production mechanisms are intentionally simplified or omitted:

- Full event / hook bus behavior, such as `PreToolUse`, `SessionStart/End`, and `ConfigChange`.
  The teaching code uses minimal lifecycle events where needed.
- Rule-based permission governance and full trust workflows.
- Session lifecycle controls such as resume/fork, plus more complete worktree lifecycle handling.
- Full MCP runtime details such as transport, OAuth, resource subscription, and polling.

The JSONL mailbox protocol in this repository is a teaching implementation, not a claim about any specific production internal implementation.

## 20 Progressive Lessons

**Each lesson adds one harness mechanism. Each mechanism has a motto.**

> **s01** &nbsp; *"One loop & Bash is all you need"* &mdash; one tool + one loop = one agent
>
> **s02** &nbsp; *"Adding a tool means adding one handler"* &mdash; the loop stays untouched; new tools register into the dispatch map
>
> **s03** &nbsp; *"Set boundaries first, then grant freedom"* &mdash; check what can run, what must stop, and what needs approval
>
> **s04** &nbsp; *"Hook around the loop, never rewrite the loop"* &mdash; add extension points without changing the main loop
>
> **s05** &nbsp; *"An agent without a plan drifts"* &mdash; list the steps before starting; completion rate doubles
>
> **s06** &nbsp; *"Big tasks split small, each subtask gets clean context"* &mdash; subagents do the side work and bring back only the result
>
> **s07** &nbsp; *"Load knowledge on demand, not upfront"* &mdash; list skills first, expand them only when needed
>
> **s08** &nbsp; *"Context always fills up -- have a way to make room"* &mdash; multi-layer compaction strategies buy you infinite sessions
>
> **s09** &nbsp; *"Remember what matters, forget what doesn't"* &mdash; three subsystems: selection, extraction, consolidation
>
> **s10** &nbsp; *"Prompts are assembled at runtime, not hardcoded"* &mdash; section-based concatenation, loaded on demand
>
> **s11** &nbsp; *"Errors aren't the end, they're the start of a retry"* &mdash; retry, make room, or take another path when things fail
>
> **s12** &nbsp; *"Big goals break into small tasks, ordered, persisted to disk"* &mdash; a file-backed task graph that lays the groundwork for multi-agent coordination
>
> **s13** &nbsp; *"Slow ops go background, agent keeps thinking"* &mdash; background threads run commands; notifications inject on completion
>
> **s14** &nbsp; *"Fire on schedule, no human kick needed"* &mdash; trigger tasks automatically by time
>
> **s15** &nbsp; *"Too big for one agent -- delegate to teammates"* &mdash; persistent teammates + async mailboxes
>
> **s16** &nbsp; *"Teammates need shared communication rules"* &mdash; use a fixed request-reply format for coordination
>
> **s17** &nbsp; *"Teammates check the board, claim work themselves"* &mdash; no leader assigning one by one; self-organizing
>
> **s18** &nbsp; *"Each works in its own directory, no interference"* &mdash; tasks own goals, worktrees own directories, bound by ID
>
> **s19** &nbsp; *"Not enough capability? Plug in more via MCP"* &mdash; connect external tools into the same tool pool
>
> **s20** &nbsp; *"Many mechanisms, one loop"* &mdash; all previous mechanisms return to one complete harness

that holds the LLM client, agent harness, hooks, permissions,
compactor, memory, skills, tasks, background runner, cron, message
bus, and teammate runtime.

## How to Read

Each chapter is a folder. Open one and you will find:

```
s08_context_compact/
  README.md              # full narrative with inline code
  README.en.md           # English translation
  README.ja.md           # Japanese translation
  Program.cs             # standalone runnable implementation (.NET 10 / C#)
  appsettings.json       # per-chapter C# config (git-ignored)
  appsettings.example.json  # tracked template
  s08_context_compact.csproj
  images/                # SVG diagrams (where needed)
```

Read the `README.md` for the core idea and work through the code. Complex chapters have `<details>` folds for deep dives -- open them when you want to go deeper. Simple chapters have 0-1 diagrams, complex chapters have more.

Read from s01 through s20 in order. Each chapter assumes you've read the previous ones and ends with a hook into the next.

---

## Quick Start

### 20-Lesson Track (.NET 10 / C#)

A full .NET 10 C# port lives in this folder. Each `sNN_*` chapter is a
self-contained console app; the shared machinery lives in
`AgentCommon/`. The harness talks to **DeepSeek** via its
Anthropic-compatible endpoint using `deepseek-v4-flash` as the default
model.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shareAI-lab/learn-claude-code
cd learn-claude-code
dotnet build                                                # restore + build the whole solution

# Configure your API key (one-time)
cp s01_agent_loop/appsettings.example.json s01_agent_loop/appsettings.json
# Then edit s01_agent_loop/appsettings.json and replace PUT-YOUR-KEY-HERE
# with your DeepSeek API key. Repeat for any other chapter you want to run.
# Alternative: set the env var DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...

dotnet run --project s01_agent_loop         # Start here -- one loop + bash
dotnet run --project s08_context_compact    # Context compaction (complex)
dotnet run --project s20_comprehensive      # Endpoint: all mechanisms in one loop
```

#### Configuring your API key

The harness reads its config from `appsettings.json` placed next to
the chapter you are running. `Directory.Build.props` at the repo root
already copies any `appsettings.json` it finds into the build output,
so no extra project edits are needed.

```
s01_agent_loop/
  appsettings.json          ← your local config (git-ignored)
  appsettings.example.json  ← template, tracked in git
  Program.cs
  s01_agent_loop.csproj
```

The `.gitignore` excludes `appsettings.json` so you cannot accidentally
commit your key. There are two ways to provide credentials:

1. **Edit `appsettings.json`** next to the chapter you want to run
   (easiest). Replace `PUT-YOUR-KEY-HERE` with your real key.
2. **Set the environment variable** `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` (or
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) before launching the app.

The same settings file is shared across all chapters. You can change
`modelId`, `baseUrl`, `maxTokens`, `maxTokensEscalation`, and
`fallbackModel` there.

#### Switching the LLM engine

The default base URL is DeepSeek's Anthropic-compatible endpoint
(`https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic`) and the default model is
`deepseek-v4-flash`. To use a different Anthropic-compatible provider,
edit `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "modelId": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "baseUrl": "https://api.anthropic.com",
  "apiKey": "sk-ant-..."
}
```

### Web Platform

The current web app renders the legacy 12-lesson `docs/` track; the
content has been ported to C# but the Next.js app still consumes the
`docs/` Markdown. Use the root-level folders (`s01_*` ... `s20_*`)
for the canonical narrative.

```sh
cd web && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

## What's Next

After 20 lessons, you understand harness engineering from the inside out. Two paths to turn that knowledge into product:

### Kode Agent CLI -- Open-Source Coding Agent CLI

> `npm i -g @shareai-lab/kode`

Skill and LSP support, Windows compatible, works with GLM / MiniMax / DeepSeek and other open models. Install and go.

GitHub: **[shareAI-lab/Kode-Agent](https://github.com/shareAI-lab/Kode-Agent)**

### Kode Agent SDK -- Embed Agent Capabilities in Your Application

A standalone library with no per-user process overhead. Embed it in backends, browser extensions, embedded devices, or any runtime.

## Sister Tutorial: From Passive Sessions to Always-On Assistants

The harness taught in this repository is the **use-and-discard** kind -- open a terminal, give the agent a task, close when done, next session starts fresh. Claude Code works this way.

But [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) proves another possibility: on the same agent core, two additional harness mechanisms turn an agent from "poke it and it moves" into "wakes itself every 30 seconds to look for work":

- **Heartbeat** -- every 30 seconds the harness sends the agent a message, letting it check for pending work. Nothing to do? Keep sleeping. Something appeared? Act immediately.
- **Cron** -- the agent can schedule its own future tasks, which fire automatically when the time arrives.

Add IM multi-channel routing (WhatsApp / Telegram / Slack / Discord and 13+ other platforms), persistent context memory, and a Soul personality system, and the agent transforms from a disposable tool into an always-on personal AI assistant.

**[claw0](https://github.com/shareAI-lab/claw0)** is our sister teaching repository, breaking down these harness mechanisms from scratch:

```
claw agent = agent core + heartbeat + cron + IM chat + memory + soul
```

```

 loop, tools, planning,               heartbeat, cron, IM channels,
 teams, worktree isolation)            memory, Soul personality)
```

**Agency comes from the model. The harness gives agency a place to land. Build the harness well, and the model will do the rest.**

**Bash is all you need. Real agents are all the universe needs.**

**This is not "copy the source code." This is "grasp the key designs and build it yourself."**
